# The Path to Victory
NFL Playoff Bracket Challenge

Every year my friends and I do an NFL Playoff pool. For every game in the playoffs, we pick the winner. After the Superbowl, whoever has the most bracket points wins the prize. Points are given as 50, 75, 150, and 300 points for each correct winner chosen in the wildcard round, divisional round, championship round, and Superbowl, respectively.

This program calculates all the possible bracket scenarios from the divisional round on, highlighting the outcome of the bracket challenge based on which teams win. It allows everyone to see their path to victory and highlights the most important games for determining the winner.

The figure below shows the output of the program - a nicely formatted spreadsheet that shows how many points each person has and who wins the bracket challenge for all 1,296 scenarios:
