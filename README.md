# The Path to Victory
NFL Playoff Bracket Challenge

Every year my friends and I do an NFL Playoff pool. For every game in the playoffs, we pick the winner. After the Superbowl, whoever has the most bracket points wins the prize. Points are given as 50, 75, 150, and 300 points for each correct winner chosen in the wildcard round, divisional round, championship round, and Superbowl, respectively.

This program calculates all bracket point scenarios from the divisional round on. It allows everyone to see their path to victory and highlights the most important games for determining the winner.

 A nicely formatted csv file that shows how many points each person has and who wins the bracket challenge for all 1,296 scenarios (the output of bracket_scenarios.py):
