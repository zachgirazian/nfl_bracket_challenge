NFL Playoff Bracket Challenge

Every year my friends and I do an NFL Playoff Bracket Challenge. For every game in the playoffs, we pick who we think will win. The winner is the one who scores the most points after the Superbowl has ended. Points are given for each correct game: 50, 75, 150, and 300 points for correct games chosen in the wildcard round, divisional round, championship round, and Superbowl, respectively.

I wrote a program to calculate all bracket point scenarios from the divisional round on. This allows everyone to see how they can win and highlights the most important games for determining the winner.

bracket_scenarios.py: Program to calculate scenarios

nfl_brackets.csv: Everyone's playoff bracket entry

nfl_teams_info_colors.csv: Database of NFL team colors

scenarios.csv: A nicely formatted csv file that shows who wins the bracket challenge for each scenario (the output ofbracket_scenarios.py):
